# Animations

Here, I programmed animations using Manim (Python) for my master's thesis presentation. There is room for optimization, particularly in terms of code structure. When I initially programmed the animations, I was unsure of the final outcome, which led to some inefficiencies. See the animations at:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h3qsPtvcqw, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jka0KLsxvp4 .
